**I was looking at media literacy. I did a media bingo where we had to find someone who did one of the options on a sheet I could not get bingo on the ****[Media Literacy Bing**o](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B48EaMutZcj1QlU0czNicTlSd3M&authuser=0)** sheet****. Then I looked at the **[2014 Kia Soul Hamster Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DIvRKPsHU)** advert**** and I discussed the advert and looked at taget audience, hidden story and the sub text that you can't see. I also compared it with ****[Basic Media Literacy Concept**s](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B48EaMutZcj1R2FUZEQ0dlRZWlU&authuser=0)**.**
