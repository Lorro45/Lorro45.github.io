I Improved this.

I enjoyed making the identity map. I would have preferred to have shown people my self. I think it would have been better to be face to face. No I didn't enjoy going round and commenting I would have preferred to speak to them. Nobody really saw What my poster was designed to be. I am not shower. In the future I won't be posting much. I think that my use is already good. I now do not think all social media is bad. I now plan on using networking in the future.
