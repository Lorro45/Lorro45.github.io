Date: 2.10.2017   Task: Discount sheet

We were improving the Order From by making the discount code and transportation cost advance e.g depending on total cost the postage will be cheaper or more expensive. The discount part was the hardest as you had to program it so that it looked at the code that was used by the user. Then searched for the code in a table. Then found out how much of a discount it was. Then worked out how much money would be saved.
